# Building High Throughput Data Microservices
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `Building High Throughput Data Microservices`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

## Overview 

Learn how to design, implement, and manage high throughput microservices for modern data architectures.


## Concept

Data is everywhere. Processing massive amounts of data requires microservices to be architected to meet many demands.
In this course, instructor [Gregory Green](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-green-5619748/) walks you through how to meet increasing data demands for Microservices by building scalable high-throughput architectures.
Discover best practices for data patterns for throughput with flexible data services and multisite cloud-based use cases. Explore some of the most critical factors that affect data microservices. Dive deeper into antipatterns and the pros and cons of data technologies, with examples drawn from RabbitMQ, Postgres, Caching, and Spring. Along the way, Gregory gives you tips and pointers with hands-on demonstrations of how to successfully design and implement performant data microservices.


## Goals

- Millions of payment transactions using [Spring](https://spring.io)/[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- Compare throughput
  - relation databases: [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)/[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) 
  - Event Streaming: [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org)/[RabbitMQ Streams](https://www.rabbitmq.com/streams.html)
